#  Evo RL

Evo RL is a machine learning library built in Rust to explore the evolution of artificial biomemetic neural networks. The main application of this library will be for use in Reinforcement Learning type ML problems. Neural Networks are implemented as graphs specified by a direct encoding scheme, which allows crossover during selection. 

## Evolutionary Algorithm

The main evolutionary algorithm in this libary is inspired by the NEAT (K.O. Stanley and  R. Miikkulainen) and implements Stochastic Universal Sampling with Truncation as the selection mechanism.
